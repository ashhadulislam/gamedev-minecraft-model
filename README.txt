INTRODUCTION
===========

  This is a tribute to Minecraft written in OpenGL and C++. As of right now, 
  it is still very much a work in progress. Some optimizations are in place, 
  but the performance may not be great on all machines. This has been actively
  developed on Linux but it should correctly work under Windows and Mac OS as
  well (except for audio at the moment..).

COMPILATION
===========

  In Linux:

	$ cd src/
	$ make

EXECUTION
=========
  
  In Linux:
